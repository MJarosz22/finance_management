# finance_management
This is an app that that generates a Google spreadsheet with a financial overview for a given month from a csv file.
For it to work, you have to provide (a) csv file/files in the correct format. I am planning to further improve it in the future, by adding a GUI and an automatic text formatter for the csv files.
